# Grid2Op-Reinforcement-Learning-Project
This project explores the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), within the Grid2Op environment. The primary focus is on optimizing the flow of power in the l2rpn_case14_sandbox grid while adhering to the N-1 reliability criterion.
